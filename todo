Adding strategy elements:
  1. Trade (w/ opponent, and not): one resource for another
  2. Random events
     a. list of events
          i. pirate attacks you -> defense, gain or lose resources
          ii. pirate attacks enemy
          iii. malfunction -> downgrade something, spend resources to repair something
          iv. environment events (could lead to malfunction, or just loss/gain of resources, or nothing)
          v. rebellion
          vi. opportunity to upgrade for less cost
          vii. opportunity for unique upgrade
               * temp increase one planet or something
     b. other thoughts (timing, etc.)
          i. randomly generated (i.e. 5% each turn), skipping: increases event chance? two events --> incentive to skip
  3. More specific upgrades
     a. Stations:
          i. upgrading resource production vs. AoI
          ii. pirates: upgrading defense or something
          iii. AoI also determined by number of planets owned, limit AoI upgrades to fewer
  4. Conflict
  5. Spaceship
  6. Other things other than resources
     a. choosing some kind of race/etc: choosing a strategy before the game begins (bonuses and penalties) (tie it into stations)
  7. Map stuff
     a. start with space station, fill in that area's planet types.
  8. Name: Nebula 9000

Small edits/tweaks:
  1. Limit the number of times you can upgrade (done)
  2. Add cost to increase AoI (done)
>  3. Make sure all text fits in the panels
